## GraphiKa

Have you ever wanted to work with Neo4j and Graph data, but you just couldnt get used to the Cypher Syntax? or maybe didnt have time to learn it ?

GaphiKa should help you with that.

#### Coming Soon.
1. The LLM model to translate NL-Cypher, is hosted on the HuggingFace Api, however there are no deployable endpoints, so the model needs to be downloaded locally (around 10gb).
