## GraphiKa

Have you ever wanted to work with Neo4j and Graph data, but you just couldnt get used to the Cypher Syntax? or maybe didnt have time to learn it ?

GaphiKa should help you with that.

#### Current issues

1. Need to work on frontend with graphs (harder than it seems)
2. Fine tuning the LLm is also an issue (problem with peft library and bitsandbytes dependencies)
