## GraphiKa

Have you ever wanted to work with Neo4j and Graph data, but you just couldnt get used to the Cypher Syntax? or maybe didnt have time to learn it ?

GaphiKa should help you with that.

### Updates:
1. The LLM model to translate NL-Cypher, is hosted on the HuggingFace Api, however there are no deployable endpoints, so the model needs to be downloaded locally (around 10gb).
2. The dataset size (Which the LLM was trained on) currently has a small size and is maintained by me only, so the model's output are not always correct.

#### Coming Soon.
